# Microblog

By: Liam Eckert

## About

This is a microblog applicaiton written using Node.js, TypeScript, Express, PostgreSQL, and React.
This project is a work in progress and meant to be a learning experience for me. I am using this project to better understand how to build real-world applications. I chose a set of features that would maximize my learning experience. The core features of Microblog are:

- User authentication (login, logout, register)
- User profile management (view, edit, change visibility, and maybe more in future)
- User posts that can be upvoted, downvoted, echoed (reposted), and commented on
- A user feed with a few novel algorithms for sorting posts
- A search feature

Note: The features described above are currently just a plan. I will update this README as I make progress on the project.
